### Architecture Kata: Agile Dead Trees Monolithic Design in Spring

Ian Gorton, Yingyi Tong, Yuan Tian

Software architecture kata’s are an approach for exploring different architecture design approaches within the framework of a specified business problem. The brief, broad requirements statement and business goals and constraints enable students to propose different design approaches and analyze and discuss their potential effects on the resulting system qualities. Building on the architecture katas approach, recent work has used such examples as running examples to illustrate how to use various advanced software architecture patterns and techniques. 

Learning software architecture design at a conceptual level is important, and is the dominant approach used in University and professional courses. Conceptual designs however are not the end point in real systems – executable code is. Hence there exists a gap which students learning to design systems must somehow overcome. Mapping conceptual designs to real software platforms and languages is rarely a straightforward exercise, and one we feel should be front and center in the education of a software architect.

In this repo, we aim to provide an example of exploring design options for an architecture kata and illustrating the implications of these options in code. We’ll base this work on the Agile Dead Trees architecture kata described [here](https://medium.com/@goodmove_/architecture-kata-agile-dead-trees-789f16f5ac2c0).  We'll start with a monolithic architecture built using Springboot and React, and then refine the design to explore various design and implementation approaches.
